# Idea Scratchpad

## Key features
- top down
- local multiplayer, where the viewport contains all the players
- procedurally generated launch 
- Players can shoot projectiles at teammates, and the teammate "rides" the projectile for its lifespan
- fantasy-themed, possibly high-fantasy
- We like a sense of progression, but we want newbies to be able jump in and play with veterans. To address this we can:
   + make have players unlock different playable characters with different play styles
   + have the high-level player's stats "downscale" to the median player level and have the lower level players "upscale"
   + allow a party to pool their net experience for each attribute, and then redistribute those skill points amongst 
 players. The concern is that we don't want people to "game" this pooling system.
- In multiplayer: If you have multiple players playing at the same time, different portions of the same dungeons become 
accessible, where the players can both help each other and face new challenges. 
- Boss fights are included, could be beaten through attack pattern mastery (maybe different pattersn based on the numberf of players?)  

## Game Inspirations
- Enter the Gungeon: Dungeon crawler where progressions is through an account-wide unlock system
- Diablo: procedural dungeons with a good sense of progression
- Dark Cloud Series: procedural dungeons
- Binding of Isaac: 
- tLoZ; Four Swords: multiplayer dungeon-crawling
- tLoZ; Wind Waker: clever use of AI to hepl you through the dungeons

##Desired Features to add to the Engine
- have the RenderGame start with a grayscale frame, and then apply a color pallette in the frame-drawing process
- Once all the mechanics are "playable", we'll discuss concurrency
